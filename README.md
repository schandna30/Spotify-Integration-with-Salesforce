# 🎵 Spotify Integration in Salesforce LWC

This project is a Lightning Web Component (LWC) that allows users to **search for tracks on Spotify** directly from Salesforce.  
It integrates with the Spotify API through an Apex controller and displays song details, including:

- **Album cover**
- **Track name** (clickable — opens in a new tab)
- **Artists**
- **Popularity**
- **Album link** (clickable — opens in a new tab)
- **Release date**

When a user clicks the track or album link, it **redirects to Spotify in a new browser tab**.
